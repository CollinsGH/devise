# Devise

[Devise](https://www.getdevise.com) is an easy-to-use, mobile application for finding things to do. 

## The Problem

The lack of a comprehensive, mobile platform that presents fun, local events in an easily digestible format is what inspired the birth of Devise. Currently event goers must scavage the corners of the internet checkouting multiple sites. If they're lucky maybe half of the sites offer a mobile friendly site or app. Otherwise they're stuck zooming in on the tiny print on endless pages of excess information on various, slow loading websites. And that's just one source. To consult a few other options, rinse and repeat.

## The Solution

Devise does the hard work -- scouring the corners the interwebs to find interesting events. All the user has to do is swipe right if you like an event, or swipe left if you don't (think of it as the 'Tinder' of event apps). When the user is finished, they simply checkout the Timeline to see their plans for the day, then go out and have some fun.
